I am a Master's student in the Electrical and Electronics Engineering department at Bilkent University, where I am fortunate to work with [Prof. Tolga Cukur](http://kilyos.ee.bilkent.edu.tr/~cukur/). I received my B.Sc. in Electrical and Electronics Engineering at Bilkent University.

My interests lie in the intersection of machine learning, computer vision, medical imaging, and healthcare. I leverage novel deep learning and computer vision algorithms to devise state-of-the-art
biomedical imaging techniques. The focal point of my research is developing novel deep generative models for multi-modal medical
image synthesis.
