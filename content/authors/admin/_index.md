I am a Master's student at the Electrical and Electronics Engineering department of Bilkent University, where I work with [Prof. Tolga Cukur](http://kilyos.ee.bilkent.edu.tr/~cukur/). I received my B.Sc. in Electrical and Electronics Engineering at Bilkent University.
My research focuses on the synergistic combination of computer vision and medical imaging to advance healthcare by developing novel deep learning models for accelerated multi-contrast MRI synthesis, reconstruction and super-resolution as well as for the foremost computer vision problems utilizing supervised and unsupervised learning approaches.

My research interests lie in the intersection of machine learning, computer vision, medical imaging. I devise novel deep learning algorithms in order to advance healthcare. My main specialties are multi-modal image synthesis, MRI reconstruction, and diagnostics in medical imaging. I am highly interested in state-of-the-art research topics in machine learning such as transformers, federated learning, and semi-supervised learning.
